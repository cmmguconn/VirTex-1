Welcome to VirTex's documentation!
===================================

**VirTex** is a Python library for performing virtual texture analysis for atomistic dataset
Such as, calculatiing rotation matirx, Euler angles, orientation, misoirnetation, Schmid Factor, etc.

It reads dump files from `LAMMPS <https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0>`_ with pre-calculated quartonion angles from `LAMMPS <https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0>`_ or `Ovito <https://www.ovito.org/>`_ and calculate all texture related properties. VirTex offers set of *simple* and *intuitive* python scripts (**In current form**).   

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
